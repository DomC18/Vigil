First, let's calculate the total time affected by each fault:
1. Elevator fault:
    * Time between 0.1 and 0.9: 0.8 seconds
    * Time between 1.5 and 2.5: 1 second
    Total time affected: 1.8 seconds (out of a total match duration of 135 seconds)
2. Shoulder CAN fault:
    * Time between 0.3 and 0.7: 0.4 seconds
    * Time between 2 and 4: 2 seconds
    Total time affected: 2.4 seconds


Next, we need to calculate the weighted average of these times, using a percentage scale to account for the different impact of each fault. Let's assume that: 
* Elevator fault has a moderate impact (60% health penalty)
* Shoulder CAN fault has a severe impact (80% health penalty)


We can use the following formula to calculate the weighted average:
Weighted Average = (Elevator Time \* 0.6) + (Shoulder CAN Time \* 0.8)


Substituting the values, we get:
Weighted Average = (1.8 seconds \* 0.6) + (2.4 seconds \* 0.8)
= 1.08 seconds + 1.92 seconds
= 3.00 seconds


To convert this to a percentage scale, we can divide the total time affected by the total match duration:
Health Rating = (Total Time Affected / Total Match Duration) \* 100%
= (3.00 seconds / 135 seconds) \* 100%
≈ 2.22%


Now, let's apply the weighted average to this percentage scale:
Weighted Average Health Rating = (0.0222 \* 0.6) + (0.0222 \* 0.8)
= 0.0133 + 0.0177
≈ 0.031
